# Group 6 GUI Coursework - Assignment 2

## Instructions:
- `npm i` To install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` To start a local development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` To build the project to the build/ directory
- `npm run start` To start a local server after building

**You must allow location access for this project to function!**
**N.B: Most browsers don't allow access to geolocation over insecure networks so if building this and running from 'npm run start' you should run it over https OR change the url to run from 'localhost':port**
